1.  When is a for loop better than a while loop?

    A.  For Loop   -    When you know how many times an loop must run.

        While Loop -    When you DON'T know the amount times it should run.  
                        Loop runs until the logic with in the loop acheives a certain state.  
                        They require extra variables and code added to the loop to take care of the counting.
                        Evaluates to a Boolean expression.

2.  When is a if statement better than a switch statement?

    A.  If         -    If statement can NOT easily replace a switch statement.
                        Checking single values for equality can be long and cumbersome.
                        The allow for more complex evaulations. (AND and OR logic).

        Switch     -    More useful for evaluating a single value against a long list of possible values
                        such as enumeration.
